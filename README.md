**Our Goal .**We will implement a simplified version of [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com) by dealing with hashing algorithms. In particular, we will implement a LSH algorithm that takes as input an audio track and finds relevant matches. Then we will play with a dataset gathering songs from the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference. The tracks (songs) include much information. We will focus on the track information, features (extracted with librosa library from Python) and audio variables provided by Echonest (now Spotify).
