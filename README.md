# ADM-HW4
We will implement a simplified version of [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com) by dealing with hashing algorithms. In particular, we will implement a LSH algorithm that takes as input an audio track and finds relevant matches. Then we will play with a dataset gathering songs from the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference. The tracks (songs) include much information. We will focus on the track information, features (extracted with librosa library from Python) and audio variables provided by Echonest (now Spotify).

## Datasets (see the dataset branch of this repository)
We will use the following datasets:
- https://www.kaggle.com/dhrumil140396/mp3s32k for the first part of the notebook (saved as *archive.zip*)
- *echonest.csv*, *features.csv* and *tracks.csv* for the second part of the notebook
